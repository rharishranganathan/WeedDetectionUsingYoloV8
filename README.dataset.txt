# Overview
The Weeds dataset is a collection of garden weeds that can easily confuse object detection models due to similiarity of the weeds compared to its surroundings. This dataset was used with YOLOR for object detection to detect weeds in complex backgrounds.

# Training and Deployment
The weeds model has been trained in Roboflow, available for inference on the Dataset tab.

One could also build a Weeds Detector using YOLOR. This is achieved using the Roboflow Platform which you can deploy the model for robust and real-time detections. You can learn more here:  https://augmentedstartups.info/YOLOR-Get-Started
